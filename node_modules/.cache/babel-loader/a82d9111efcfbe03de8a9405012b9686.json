If you and\n//           bowled.io do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty\n//           (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, either\n//           party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any\n//           settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to\n//           the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the\n//           amount of the award, if any, to which either party is\n//           entitled.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated at the\n//           Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) in\n//           accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore\n//           International Arbitration Centre (\"SIAC Rules\") for the time\n//           being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by\n//           reference in this clause and shall govern all aspects of the\n//           arbitration, including but not limited to the method of\n//           initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the\n//           extent such rules are in conflict with these Terms. The\n//           arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral\n//           arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own costs (including\n//           attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the\n//           arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and\n//           costs of the SIAC.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Time Limits. If you or bowled.io pursues arbitration, the\n//           arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within\n//           the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for\n//           filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the\n//           SIAC Rules for the pertinent claim.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the\n//           arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any,\n//           of you and bowled.io, and the dispute will not be\n//           consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other\n//           cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have exclusive\n//           authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of\n//           this Arbitration Agreement; and (ii) resolve any dispute\n//           related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability\n//           or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but\n//           not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this\n//           Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable; and shall also\n//           have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or\n//           part of any claim. The exceptions to the preceding sentence\n//           are (1) all disputes arising out of or relating to the class\n//           action waiver, including any claim that all or part of the\n//           class action waiver is unenforceable, illegal, void or\n//           voidable, or such class action waiver has been breached,\n//           shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and\n//           not by an arbitrator; (2) all disputes arising out of or\n//           relating to the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided\n//           only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an\n//           arbitrator; and (3) all disputes arising out of or relating\n//           to whether either party has satisfied any condition\n//           precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of\n//           competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The\n//           arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary\n//           damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief\n//           available to an individual under applicable law, the SIAC\n//           Rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written\n//           award and statement of decision describing the essential\n//           findings and conclusions on which the award is based,\n//           including the calculation of any damages awarded. The\n//           arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an\n//           individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\n//           The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you\n//           and Bowled.io. Any judgment on the award rendered by the\n//           arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent\n//           jurisdiction.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR\n//           CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE\n//           A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that\n//           all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration\n//           under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are\n//           typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than\n//           rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited\n//           review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise\n//           between you and Bowled.io in any court in a suit to vacate\n//           or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND\n//           BOWLED.IO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing\n//           that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND\n//           DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST\n//           BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON\n//           A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER\n//           CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED\n//           WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is\n//           issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of\n//           any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for\n//           relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration\n//           and brought into the courts of Singapore. All other claims\n//           shall be arbitrated.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding,\n//           including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and\n//           compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The\n//           parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise\n//           required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party\n//           from submitting to a court of law any information necessary\n//           to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award,\n//           or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration\n//           Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or\n//           unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then\n//           such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect\n//           and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration\n//           Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set\n//           forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the\n//           party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall\n//           not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration\n//           Agreement.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will\n//           survive the termination of your relationship with Bowled.io.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\n//           either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a\n//           court in Singapore in order to maintain the status quo\n//           pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall\n//           not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations\n//           under this Arbitration Agreement.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the\n//           foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer\n//           Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of\n//           the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade\n//           secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration\n//           Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the\n//           parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction\n//           of the courts located within Singapore, for such purpose.\n//         </li>\n//       </ul>\n//       <h3>General</h3>\n//       <p>\n//         We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify,\n//         suspend, or discontinue the Service, or any features or parts\n//         thereof, whether temporarily or permanently, at any time with\n//         or without notice to you in our sole discretion.

You agree that all\n                    claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or\n                    other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection\n                    with these Terms or the use of any Service provided by\n                    bowled.io that cannot be resolved informally shall be\n                    resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under\n                    the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise\n                    agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in\n                    English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and\n                    bowled.io, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,\n                    employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and\n                    assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or\n                    beneficiaries of services or goods provided under these\n                    Terms.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before\n                    either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send\n                    to the other party a written notice describing the nature\n                    and basis of the claim or dispute and the requested relief\n                    (“Notice of Dispute”). A Notice of Dispute to bowled.io\n                    should be sent to: akshay.khandelwal@dfx.world. After the\n                    Notice of Dispute is received, you and bowled.io may attempt\n                    to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and\n                    bowled.io do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty\n                    (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, either\n                    party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any\n                    settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to\n                    the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the\n                    amount of the award, if any, to which either party is\n                    entitled.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated at the\n                    Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) in\n                    accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore\n                    International Arbitration Centre (\"SIAC Rules\") for the time\n                    being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by\n                    reference in this clause and shall govern all aspects of the\n                    arbitration, including but not limited to the method of\n                    initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the\n                    extent such rules are in conflict with these Terms. The\n                    arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral\n                    arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own costs (including\n                    attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the\n                    arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and\n                    costs of the SIAC.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Time Limits. If you or bowled.io pursues arbitration, the\n                    arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within\n                    the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for\n                    filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the\n                    SIAC Rules for the pertinent claim.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the\n                    arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any,\n                    of you and bowled.io, and the dispute will not be\n                    consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other\n                    cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have exclusive\n                    authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of\n                    this Arbitration Agreement; and (ii) resolve any dispute\n                    related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability\n                    or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but\n                    not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this\n                    Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable; and shall also\n                    have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or\n                    part of any claim. The exceptions to the preceding sentence\n                    are (1) all disputes arising out of or relating to the class\n                    action waiver, including any claim that all or part of the\n                    class action waiver is unenforceable, illegal, void or\n                    voidable, or such class action waiver has been breached,\n                    shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and\n                    not by an arbitrator; (2) all disputes arising out of or\n                    relating to the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided\n                    only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an\n                    arbitrator; and (3) all disputes arising out of or relating\n                    to whether either party has satisfied any condition\n                    precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of\n                    competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The\n                    arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary\n                    damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief\n                    available to an individual under applicable law, the SIAC\n                    Rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written\n                    award and statement of decision describing the essential\n                    findings and conclusions on which the award is based,\n                    including the calculation of any damages awarded. The\n                    arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an\n                    individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\n                    The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you\n                    and Bowled.io. Any judgment on the award rendered by the\n                    arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent\n                    jurisdiction.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR\n                    CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE\n                    A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that\n                    all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration\n                    under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are\n                    typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than\n                    rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited\n                    review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise\n                    between you and Bowled.io in any court in a suit to vacate\n                    or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND\n                    BOWLED.IO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing\n                    that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.

If a decision is\n                    issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of\n                    any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for\n                    relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration\n                    and brought into the courts of Singapore. All other claims\n                    shall be arbitrated.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Confidentiality.

The\n                    parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise\n                    required by law.

Such waiver shall\n                    not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration\n                    Agreement.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Survival of Agreement.

You agree that all\n//           claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or\n//           other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection\n//           with these Terms or the use of any Service provided by\n//           bowled.io that cannot be resolved informally shall be\n//           resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under\n//           the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise\n//           agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in\n//           English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and\n//           bowled.io, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,\n//           employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and\n//           assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or\n//           beneficiaries of services or goods provided under these\n//           Terms.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before\n//           either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send\n//           to the other party a written notice describing the nature\n//           and basis of the claim or dispute and the requested relief\n//           (“Notice of Dispute”). A Notice of Dispute to bowled.io\n//           should be sent to: akshay.khandelwal@dfx.world. After the\n//           Notice of Dispute is received, you and bowled.io may attempt\n//           to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and\n//           bowled.io do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty\n//           (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, either\n//           party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any\n//           settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to\n//           the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the\n//           amount of the award, if any, to which either party is\n//           entitled.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated at the\n//           Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) in\n//           accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore\n//           International Arbitration Centre (\"SIAC Rules\") for the time\n//           being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by\n//           reference in this clause and shall govern all aspects of the\n//           arbitration, including but not limited to the method of\n//           initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the\n//           extent such rules are in conflict with these Terms. The\n//           arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral\n//           arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own costs (including\n//           attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the\n//           arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and\n//           costs of the SIAC.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Time Limits. If you or bowled.io pursues arbitration, the\n//           arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within\n//           the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for\n//           filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the\n//           SIAC Rules for the pertinent claim.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the\n//           arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any,\n//           of you and bowled.io, and the dispute will not be\n//           consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other\n//           cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have exclusive\n//           authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of\n//           this Arbitration Agreement; and (ii) resolve any dispute\n//           related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability\n//           or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but\n//           not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this\n//           Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable; and shall also\n//           have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or\n//           part of any claim. The exceptions to the preceding sentence\n//           are (1) all disputes arising out of or relating to the class\n//           action waiver, including any claim that all or part of the\n//           class action waiver is unenforceable, illegal, void or\n//           voidable, or such class action waiver has been breached,\n//           shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and\n//           not by an arbitrator; (2) all disputes arising out of or\n//           relating to the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided\n//           only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an\n//           arbitrator; and (3) all disputes arising out of or relating\n//           to whether either party has satisfied any condition\n//           precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of\n//           competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The\n//           arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary\n//           damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief\n//           available to an individual under applicable law, the SIAC\n//           Rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written\n//           award and statement of decision describing the essential\n//           findings and conclusions on which the award is based,\n//           including the calculation of any damages awarded. The\n//           arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an\n//           individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\n//           The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you\n//           and Bowled.io. Any judgment on the award rendered by the\n//           arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent\n//           jurisdiction.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR\n//           CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE\n//           A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that\n//           all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration\n//           under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are\n//           typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than\n//           rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited\n//           review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise\n//           between you and Bowled.io in any court in a suit to vacate\n//           or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND\n//           BOWLED.IO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing\n//           that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND\n//           DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST\n//           BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON\n//           A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER\n//           CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED\n//           WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is\n//           issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of\n//           any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for\n//           relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration\n//           and brought into the courts of Singapore. All other claims\n//           shall be arbitrated.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding,\n//           including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and\n//           compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The\n//           parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise\n//           required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party\n//           from submitting to a court of law any information necessary\n//           to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award,\n//           or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration\n//           Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or\n//           unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then\n//           such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect\n//           and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration\n//           Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set\n//           forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the\n//           party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall\n//           not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration\n//           Agreement.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will\n//           survive the termination of your relationship with Bowled.io.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\n//           either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a\n//           court in Singapore in order to maintain the status quo\n//           pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall\n//           not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations\n//           under this Arbitration Agreement.\n//         </li>\n//         <li>\n//           Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.
