We are not aware of the identity of the user\n                  from which we have collected the Non-Personal Information.\n                  Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which\n                  is available to us while Users are using the Site, Apps and/or\n                  Service. Non-Personal Information which is being gathered\n                  consists of technical information and behavioural information,\n                  and may contain, among other things, type of operating system\n                  (e.g. Windows, Linux, etc.), computer configurations, screen\n                  resolution (e.g. 800x600, 1024x768, etc.), type of web browser\n                  used, keyboard language (e.g. English), location data, the\n                  activity of the user on the Site, Apps and / or Service\n                  (including dates and times and duration of use, and the nature\n                  of the resources and features accessed), details of the user’s\n                  internet service provider or mobile carrier, and the user's\n                  “click-stream” on the Site, Apps and / or Service. In\n                  addition, Non-Personal Information may include information you\n                  provide to us through inquiries and / or feedback, as well as\n                  when you report a problem with the Site, Apps and / or\n                  Service, including the textual information you submit to help\n                  us reproduce the issue, and screenshots. This is statistical\n                  data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does\n                  not identify any individual.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                  The second type of information is PII (as defined above). Each\n                  user of the Site, Apps and / or Service automatically provides\n                  the user’s IP address and unique device identifiers mainly for\n                  enhancing the user's experience and for geolocation and\n                  security purposes. In addition, PII collected and stored\n                  consists of any personal details provided consciously and\n                  voluntarily by you when the user wish to contact us or\n                  subscribe for a demo via forms on the Site or Apps, or send us\n                  customer service related requests; specifically: your first\n                  and last name, your e-mail address(es), your job title, the\n                  name of your company or entity, your industry, your phone\n                  number, your credit card or other billing information, and\n                  copies or records of your correspondence with us. For\n                  avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Information connected or\n                  linked to any PII shall be deemed as PII as long as such\n                  connection or linkage exists. We do not collect any PII from\n                  you or related to you without your approval, which is\n                  obtained, inter alia, through your active acceptance of the\n                  Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3>Cookies</h3>\n                <p>\n                  Cookies are small text files that websites save to your\n                  computer.
